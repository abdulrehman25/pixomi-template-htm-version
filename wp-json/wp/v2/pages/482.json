We work closely together with our clients to break down overarching goals to the individual level, in order for all employees to see how they contribute and thereby carry responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>Actium domque, eligendi natus omnis culpa excepturi laboriosam, reiciendis fuga repellendus sequi aut delectus numquam a accusamus voluptatum dolorum distinctio vitae nihil consequatur laborum alias, animi adipisci voluptates!

On the other hand, we have no clients who do not achieve at least some of the established targets, and it is of great importance to our viability that they do achieve them. We get fully paid only after we together with our customers reach the targets that we developed together.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;What Industries do you Specialize in?&#8221; style=&#8221;arrow&#8221;]We take pride in our ability to learn the fundamentals of virtually any industry or technology quickly. Some of the markets we have served include green technologies, medical devices, biotechnology, Internet\/e-commerce, telecommunications, distance education\/e-learning, real estate, financial services, healthcare services, manufacturing, retail, food service, consumer products, media and entertainment, aerospace, artificial intelligence, enterprise software, insurance, energy, and networking. Having said that, we believe that the value we bring to the table is not industry expertise \u2014 which you already possess in abundance \u2014 but rather an understanding of what investors like to see in a potential opportunity.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;Whats Makes Your Business Plans so Special?&#8221; style=&#8221;arrow&#8221;]Most importantly, they work. In a world in which fewer than 1 in 250 business plans ever raise venture capital, we are happy to report that about half of our plans have raised capital, and a good portion of the rest resulted in an acquisition or currently have commitments for investment from prior round investors. Each plan is hand crafted to reflect the client\u2019s specific circumstances, yet share attributes that investors find appealing.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;What is Your Refund Policy?&#8221; style=&#8221;arrow&#8221;]Your initial payment is non-refundable. This is because by the time you have decided to hire us, we have already set aside time to work with you, and we may even have turned away other opportunities in order to provide you with the best possible experience. Subsequent payments are subject to a pro-rated refund if you choose to terminate the project before we have fully earned the subsequent payment. For example, suppose fees for your project are broken into three payments, each covering 20 hours of services. The initial payment covers the first 20 hours, and the second payment covers the next 20 hours. If you change your mind about the project after we have put a total of 30 hours into the project, you would be entitled to a refund for half of the second payment because we will only have earned 10 hours of it.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;What are Your Qualifications?&#8221; style=&#8221;arrow&#8221;]We\u2019re all experienced entrepreneurs. Many have MBAs from top schools Top Rated Universities, and some have PhDs in scientific areas. Most importantly, we have proven track records.
